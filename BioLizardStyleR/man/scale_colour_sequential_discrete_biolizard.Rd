\usage{
scale_colour_sequential_discrete_biolizard(...)

scale_color_sequential_discrete_biolizard(...)
}
\description{
Use this function with ggplot where color corresponds to discrete categories, applying the sequential Biolizard palette.
}
\details{
The sequential palette represents the underlying values using a consistent sequence of increasing luminance.
The hue is derived from the Biolizard green. The palette utilizes gradients within the HCL-spectrum for perceptual uniformity.
The chroma follows a triangular progression to help differentiate the middle range values from the extreme values.
