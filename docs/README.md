# Introduction

Data visualization is an important aspect the work we do at BioLizard. To ensure that we follow best practices as much as possible, we initiated the "nature-grade visualization" innovation project. One of the goals of this project to develop R and Python packages to add a consistent visual style to our figures. Some prime candidates are [ggplot2](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/ggplot2/index.html), [matplotlib](https://matplotlib.org/), and [seaborn](https://seaborn.pydata.org/)). This repository acts as a "pre-production" playground to work on this development.

For a list of guidelines and best practices that everyone within BioLizard should adhere to, please refer to [this](https://www.notion.so/biolizard/Data-visualization-best-practices-a5a056f107584951af6e6dc8befe1d66?pvs=4) Notion document. Turn to [this](https://www.notion.so/3c8b944dcc974b3791f9fee398a6d346?pvs=21) one for a more in depth discussion about some of the data visualization do’s and don’ts.

# Packages in This Repository

This repository contains two key packages:

1. [BioLizardStyleR](https://lizard-bio.github.io/nature-grade-visualization-playground/BioLizardStyleR) - An R package designed for ggplot2.
2. [BioLizardStylePython](https://lizard-bio.github.io/nature-grade-visualization-playground/BioLizardStylePython) - A Python package designed for matplotlib, also compatible with seaborn.

Developed by Robbe Neirynck during an internship at BioLizard, under the supervision of Alexander Koch.
Development was continued by Anikó Meijer.
