```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)
```

Some packages to help me setup this package: 
```{r}
library(roxygen2) # In-Line Documentation for R 
library(usethis)  # Automate Package and Project Setup
library(devtools) # Tools to Make Developing R Packages Easier
library(testthat) # Unit Testing for R
```
This is my first time writing an R package
I followed the website for a https://www.mzes.uni-mannheim.de/socialsciencedatalab/article/r-package/ walkthrough on how to create your first package.

I also find this [cheatsheet](https://rawgit.com/rstudio/cheatsheets/master/package-development.pdf) a really helpfull overview of the functions of all the different parts of a package.

In the R files I will try to adhere to the [tidyverse style guide](https://style.tidyverse.org/index.html).

Tidyverses things to rememeber:
! public functions and their documentation should appear first, with private functions appearing after all documented functions

-> Let's not worry about github for now
